      <p>The épée (English: /ˈɛpeɪ/ or /ˈeɪpeɪ/, French pronunciation: ​[epe]) is the largest and heaviest of the three weapons used in sport fencing. The modern épée derives from the 19th-century Épée de Combat,[1] a weapon which itself derives from the French small sword. As a thrusting weapon, the épée is similar to a foil (compared to a sabre, which is also designed for slashing) but has a stiffer blade, which is triangular in cross-section with a V-shaped groove called a fuller. It also has a larger bell guard and weighs more. The technique is somewhat different, as there are no rules regarding priority and right of way. In addition, the entire body is a valid target area.</p></td>
